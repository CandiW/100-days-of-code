# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Project:** Free Code Camp Project - The Game of Life in React.js and SASS

**Today's Progress**: Toggle color of cells onClick

**Intro:** I'd already laid out the design of this project before Christmas, but took some time off for the holidays, and decided to wait to work out the JS until after the New Year.

**Thoughts:** Today, I worked on the changeColor function to toggle the color of the cells onClick. Also, pushing the cells into an array, so I can develop the patterns required in the Game of Life.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Project:** Free Code Camp Project - The Game of Life in React.js and SASS

**Today's Progress:** Worked on a function to develop the patterns...

**Thoughts:** Have some research to do and YouTube videos to watch, but I attempted to add a group of cells into a 2d array so I could then check if they're alive/dead....
